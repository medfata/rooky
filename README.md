# Rooky Website

This is a static website built with HTML and Tailwind CSS, inspired by ScrollSloth.com. The website is designed to be deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The main HTML file
- `assets/` - Directory containing images and other media files

## How to Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Push this repository to GitHub
2. Go to the repository settings
3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
4. Select the branch you want to deploy (usually `main` or `master`)
5. The site will be published at `https://username.github.io/repository-name/`

## Customization

### Adding Images
Place your images in the `assets` folder and update the references in the HTML file.

For the hero background, replace `assets/hero-bg.jpg` with your own image.

### Modifying Content
Edit the `index.html` file to change the text, colors, and layout of the website.

### Styling
The website uses Tailwind CSS via CDN. You can modify the styles directly in the HTML file using Tailwind's utility classes.
